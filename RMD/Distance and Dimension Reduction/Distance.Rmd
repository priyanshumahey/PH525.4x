## Distance

**Distance** is defined as a value that permits us to say what animals are "close" to each other. A lot of analysis requires a good understanding of distance, especially when it comes to clustering or ML.

## Euclidean Distance
Euclidean Distance is the distance in a Euclidean space.

The distance here is just $\sqrt{(A_{x}-B_{x})^{2}+(A_{y}-B_{y})^2}$

For high dimensional data, we can't exactly rely on this method.


```{r options, echo=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("genomicsclass/tissuesGeneExpression")
library(tissuesGeneExpression)
data(tissuesGeneExpression)
dim(e) ##e contains the expression data
```

```{r}
table(tissue)
```
